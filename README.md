# Drishti

Drishti is an open-source scientific visualisation software designed by Ajay Limaye at the National Computational Infrastructure's VizLab.

The central idea of Drishti is that scientists can use it to explore and present volumetric datasets without extensive training.

Drishti has been developed with its end use in mind: ie. visualising volumetric data, such as tomography data, electron-microscopy data, etc.

Drishti works on GPUs with OpenGL 2.0 capability.

Drishti stands for vision or insight in Sanskrit, an Indian language.
